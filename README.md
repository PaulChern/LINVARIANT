# LINVARIANT
**LINVARIANT** is a Universal model generator, in the field of computational condensed matter physics. <br />
**INVARIANT** are such objects though we construct with the help of coordinate systems turn out to be independent of coordinates. <br />
**L** is to memorize famous physicist Lev Davidovich Landau (22 January 1908 â€“ 1 April 1968). <br />
- Utilizing the Group Theory, it mathematically modeling physics systems such as Lattice, Electron, Spin and their coupling systems.
- LINVARIANT generates symmetry adapted microscopic or phenomenological models.
- LINVARIANT creates DFT training sets for the model fitting.
- LINVARIANT has numerical solvers running on the model, such as MC, MD, Exact diagnalization, Minimization, and et al..
- For large scale calculations, LINVARIANT exports the symbolic models into FORTRAN modules.
## Features:
